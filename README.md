# Dataflow Program Example

Worked in a team of eight to create a Java FX application wherein users were able to create, manipulate and view multiple geometric data flow sequences comprised of the provided components or user-generated code at run-time. Not the whole project as it was some time ago but I did find some screenshots and files I had worked on regarding the UI and the pop-ups for module creation.
